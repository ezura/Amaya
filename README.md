## Amaya

Amaya is a Web editor, i.e. a tool used to create and update documents directly on the Web.<br/>
Browsing features are seamlessly integrated with the editing and remote access features in a uniform environment.<br/>
This follows the original vision of the Web as a space for collaboration and not just a one-way publishing medium.
